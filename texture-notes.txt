Textures are given in UV coordinates

They start at the upper left corner as 0,0, the bottom right corner is 1,1

Each vertex will now need to be given a UV texture coordinate in addition to its position.

That is a "mapping" and the rendering engine must figure out how to apply the texture

Of course, the UV coordinates are stored in a VBO in the VAO.

Texture coordinates can really map any way you want and the rendering engine will do the math and
fill in stretching, mishaping as much as it needs to wrap the coordinates.
