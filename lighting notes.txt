lighting notes

Depending on the position and angle of the light, certain faces will brighter than others. The more a surface is facing 
a light, the brighter it will appear.

Normals are perpendicular to the face. It tells us which direction a face is pointing. Most normals can be exported or you can
calculate them on the fly.

We'll be storing normals in attribute 2 of our VAO.

Once you have the normal, you can calculate the brightness for a vertex. First you draw a vector from the vertex directly to the
light source. Then you calculate the angle between that vector and the normal. The closer the vectors are to one another
the more light the vertex is receiving. This means that every vector in a mesh will have two vectors
one pointed directly at the light source and another that is the normal.

Simply use the scaler product of two vectors. The Dot product says that if the two vectors overlap, then they are one, perpendicular 0, and opposite is -1.
